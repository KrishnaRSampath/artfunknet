					<p class="description"><span class="definition-color highlight">XP:</span> Earning XP increases your collector level. As you reach higher collector levels, you will unlock more inventory space, auction slots, and other features.</p>
					<p class="description"><span class="definition-color highlight">inventory:</span> The inventory section indicates how many items you have in your inventory, on display, up for auction, and in your permanent collection. The maximum of each of these values is shown in the parentheses, which can be increased by earning XP and leveling up.</p>
					<p class="description"><span class="definition-color highlight">entry fee:</span> This is the amount of money you charge for other players to access your gallery. You can modify it by clicking the <i class="fa fa-edit"></i> button.</p>
					<p class="description"><span class="definition-color highlight">current tickets:</span> This area shows the galleries you currently have access to. Once you pay the entry fee for a gallery, you can access that gallery for 30 minutes.</p>

					<p class="description"><span class="definition-color highlight">rarity:</span> Different paintings have varying degrees of rarity. Rarity effects the painting’s value and number of attributes.</p>
					<p class="description"><span class="definition-color highlight">condition:</span> Condition effects the value of a painting. The condition of your paintings will reduce each tim they’re displayed, but can be improved by meeting preservationists in other galleries.</p>
					<p class="description"><span class="definition-color highlight">attributes:</span> Each item is given randomly-generated attributes. These attributes determine what type of special visitors will appear in your gallery. For instance, galleries with several paintings on display that have the “Benefactor bonus” will be more likely to be visited by a Benefactor.</p>
					<p class="description"><span class="definition-color highlight">xp rating:</span> Displaying paintings and adding paintings to your permanent collection are both ways of earning XP. The amount earned in each case is determined by that item’s XP rating.</p>
					<p class="description"><span class="definition-color highlight">sell:</span> Selling unwanted or unused paintings earns you money and permanently removes them from your inventory.</p>
					<p class="description"><span class="definition-color highlight">auction:</span> You can put items on the auction house for other players to bid on them. Including a “buy now” price is optional, and allows players to purchase the auctioned item outright instead of waiting for the auction to conclude.</p>
					<p class="description"><span class="definition-color highlight">display:</span> Displaying items makes them inaccessible for a set period of time, but earns you XP and money in return. Once you display a painting, it becomes visible to other players that pay your set entry fee. The attributes of the paintings on display determine the type and frequency of special visitors that appear in your gallery.</p>
					<p class="description"><span class="definition-color highlight">reroll:</span> Rerolling attributes allows you to spend money in order to modify attributes on a painting. You may reroll the value of an attribute, or reroll the attribute itself. The more a painting’s attributes/values are rerolled, the more expensive it becomes, though the “roll count” of a painting can be reduced by interacting with Art Experts in galleries.</p>
					<p class="description"><span class="definition-color highlight">permanent collection:</span> Your permanent collection can be seen alongside whatever paintings you are currently displaying, but the attributes of these paintings do NOT determine what special visitors will appear in your gallery. Paintings in your permanent collection generate XP per hour based on their XP rating. The longer they are part of your permanent collection, the more XP they will generate. The rarity, condition, and attributes of paintings in your permanent collection have no effect on your gallery whatsoever.</p>
